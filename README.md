alpha is 0. This means that it only tries to follow the original pendulum on the right. <br>
E1 can be below or above E0 as it's unconstrained. <br>

alpha is 1. This means that it only tries to constrain E1 to be below E0. <br>

![](alpha0-17.gif)

alpha is 0.17. This is a balance between only following the pendulum and trying to get E1 to be below E0.
